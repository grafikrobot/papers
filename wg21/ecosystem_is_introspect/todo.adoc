== Done!

* Define the scope of what introspection means to answer. (done)
* Consider the single minimal argument introspection as a minimal conforming api. (added min/full layers design)
* Add samples scenarios for using introspection. (done, kinda)
* Compare it to the c++ feature macros. (done)
* Specify version number decimal interpretation in introspection wording.
* Disallow leading zeros, like JSON and Sematic Versioning.
* Allow multiple ranges.
* Allow digits in names?

== To-do?

* Add an example for p1689. (seems unnecessary)
