executing ==> execution

'''

Need freestanding note on feature test macro.

breakpoint & is_debugger_present

Use wording from https://eel.is/c++draft/stacktrace.entry.obs

The intent is


—++ [[http://wg21.link/p2546r4][P2546r4]]

```
RFRM presenting
MD: we should not have shoulds in notes: is expected should in disguise
MD: also, one note says recommended practice: should that be a recommended practice
CT: “The intention of the debugging functionality is to interact …” “
MD: will the debugging facility become freestanding?
BC: yes
JW: so add “, freestanding” to the feature test macro; see [[http://wg21.link/p2338r4][P2338r4]]
FB: [debugging.general] is oddly phrased
JW: remove “implementation-defined behavior of”
CT: I would even remove “interact”
MD: I don’t like “program” to be the subject and would prefer “execution of the program”
CT: I also don’t like the “implementation-defined” part
JW: I dislike “most commonly”
JW: “, such as a debugger”
CT: why are the members noexcept?
JW: do these function have a precondition?
JG: we should strike the Effects and do what is in the chat
JG: that is for breakpoint and is_debugger_present
TK: can implementation defined stuff return an indeterminate value?
FB: it isn’t useful to change
DK: we strike “Returns” after “Returns:”
MD: the other notes also gets edited
JW: “...”
JW: say the same thing without “should”
MD: “On Windows this can be achieved by…”; likewise elsewhere
```
