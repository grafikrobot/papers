. We need to finalize the expected content of the IS (matches item https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2656r1.html#_2023_2_plan[P2656-6.1]). I.e. we need to agree on what of the goals listed in P2656 will or will not be included (https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2656r1.html#_goals[P2656-5]). Items for consideration:

.. Build System <==> PM Interop? (i.e. https://github.com/isocpp/pkg-fmt[isocpp/pkg-fmt, D2800])

.. Recognized standard file names?

.. Introspection (i.e. http://wg21.link/p2717[P2717]) (We already decided on this one. Just including it here for completeness.)

.. Structured Diagnostic Output? (possibly https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/sarif-v2.1.0.html[SARIF-2.1.0])

.. Command line arguments?

.. Anything else?

. We need volunteers to sign up to work and submit papers for each of the items we agree on.

. Agree on the current skeleton IS draft document
(https://github.com/cplusplus/ecosystem-is[cplusplus/ecosystem-is]).

.. Does it look correct and ready for basing wording in forthcoming papers?

.. Who is going to be the IS editor & co-editor?

From Jens:

* (DONE) Mention CWG as the wording review gate for bootstrap process.
* (DONE) Outline plan to start wording review as soon as there's wording for one
feature + introspection.
